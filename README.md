Tarsier is a 3d viewer for RDF knowledge bases. It is highly experimental! Tarsier has been developed by Fabio Viola @ University of Bologna.

## Getting started

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/desmovalvo/tarsier

Then, once you enter its directory, install the requirements with (mind the sharp symbol, meaning you have to be root):

```bash
# pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you're ready! Start the tarsier server with:
